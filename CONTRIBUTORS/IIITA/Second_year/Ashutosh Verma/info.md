## Que(issue-10):
Create a directory inside CONTRIBUTORS of any name. <br>
Now add, commit and push your changes to the repo.<br>
So simple, just do that.<br>

But in doing so you will face a problem.
I want that problem (you faced above) and the reason for that problem i.e. why you are facing that problem inside your info.md file.

## Ans:
The problem is after creating an empty directory in CONTRIBUTORS whenever I was trying to track that same empty folder through git status commands not able to track it not even able to push it to remote repository.

The reason for the same problem is that git doesn't include them in commits and it certainly doesn't include an empty directory when we push to GitHub.
